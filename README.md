# Solving your first Lab

## Objectives

1. Open a lab by clicking "Open" on this page on Learn.co
2. Run the lab's tests with the `learn` CLI command
3. Make a change to your local copy of this lab
4. Pass the tests using the `learn` CLI command
5. Submit the passing lab with the `learn submit` CLI command

## Instructions

This lab is just about practicing the lab workflow on Learn using the `learn` CLI.

1. Click on the "Open" link on the lab toolbar above.

After you click on this, your Learn IDE will launch. 

2. After the lab is opened, your IDE should already be in the lab's directory. However if it's not, you may need to click through the file 1 or 2 levels deep to find the labs' files in the "labs" directory.

This setup—your console open in the lab's directory and the lab directory open in the file browser—that's the state you want to be in when working on a lab on Learn. It means you're ready.

3. In the console, run the test suite by typing `learn` and hitting enter. You'll see something similar to:

![lab-fail](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-ver/nitrous_lab_fail.png)

You can see your test is currently failing, which is fine, we haven't done any work yet, so it makes sense.

The failure reads: `Make sure you have added a new file or edited edit-me.txt`

4. To pass this lab, make any change to the content of the file that ends in `.rb`.


5. Once your local tests are passing, you can submit this lab by running `learn submit` from your terminal.

![learn-submit](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-ver/nitrous_learn_submit.png)

You should see this lab pass on Learn.co. Congratulations! You've just solved your first lab.
